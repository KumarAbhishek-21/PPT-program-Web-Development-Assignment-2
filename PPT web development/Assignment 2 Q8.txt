Absolute Position:

->With position: absolute, an element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (an ancestor element with a position value of relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).

->If there is no positioned ancestor, the element is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport).

Relative Position:

->With position: relative, an element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.

->Relative positioned elements can be moved using offset properties like top, right, bottom, and left.

Sticky Position:

->With position: sticky, an element is positioned based on its normal position in the document flow until a specified scroll threshold is reached. Then it becomes "stuck" in place relative to its nearest scrollable ancestor.

->Sticky positioning combines elements of both relative and fixed positioning.

Fixed Position:

->With position: fixed, an element is positioned relative to the viewport and remains fixed in place even when the page is scrolled.

->Fixed positioned elements are removed from the normal document flow, and other elements ignore them.
